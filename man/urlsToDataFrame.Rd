\title{Function for parsing urls and specified nodes into data frames}
\usage{
  urlsToDataFrame(urls,
    tables = list(atbat = NULL, pitch = NULL))
}
\arguments{
  \item{urls}{set of urls for parsing}

  \item{tables}{list of character vectors containing field
  names for each table. The list names have to correspond
  to XML nodes of interest within the XML files.}
}
\value{
  Returns a data frames if the length of tables is one.
  Otherwise, it returns a list of data frames.
}
\description{
  The primary use for this function is to scrape an
  "atbats" table and the corresponding "pitch" (ie, Pitch
  F/X) table for the specified set of URLs. In fact, this
  function is used as the core functionality behind
  \code{scrapePitchFX}. This function provides added
  flexibility by allowing one to specify nodes of interest
  other than "atbat" and "pitch". If the value of the list
  is NULL, this function will automatically generate the
  most complete collection of data points. \bold{Important:
  You must have "atbat" AND "pitch" nodes if you want to
  identify who threw a particular pitch. Also, if you
  specify field names for the table, you should be
  confident that those are the most complete set of
  fields.}
